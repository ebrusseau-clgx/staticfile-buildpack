Thanks for contributing to the buildpack. To speed up the process of reviewing your pull request please provide us with:

* A short explanation of the proposed change:
Add configuration options to buildpack that when enabled will configure nginx with the following vulnerability prevention measures:
 - Option "xss_protection: true" will set the X-XSS-Protection request header with the value "1; mode=block"
 - Option "mime_nosniff: true" will set the X-Content-Type-Options request header with the value "nosniff"

* An explanation of the use cases your change solves
This is a common use case, similar to HSTS; enabling common security preventions should be selectively configurable
